# Seq2Seq Model with Attention in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with Bahdanau Attention. The model is designed to handle sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and more.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of three main components:

### Encoder

The Encoder is implemented as a bidirectional GRU layer. It takes the input sequence and converts it into a fixed-size representation, which is then used by the decoder for generating the output sequence.

### Bahdanau Attention

The attention mechanism is crucial for the Seq2Seq model's ability to focus on different parts of the input sequence during decoding. It enhances the decoder's performance by assigning different weights to different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step.

### Decoder

The Decoder is another bidirectional GRU layer. It generates the output sequence by taking into account the context vectors obtained from the attention mechanism. The output sequence is produced step-by-step, and each step's output is used as input for the next step.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/mohamed-em2m/chatbot_seq2seq_with_attention_pytorch.git ```

2. Make sure you have PyTorch installed. Install the required libraries if necessary.

3. Train the model by running the main training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

4. You can use the trained model to generate translations or perform other sequence-to-sequence tasks:

```bash
python generate.py --input "your_input_text_here"
```
